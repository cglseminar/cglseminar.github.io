The seminar takes place on every second Thursday (see below for the schedule) in the Russell Love room of Peter Hall at the University of Melbourne, 11am-12pm AEDT. The seminars will also be streamed live via [Zoom](https://unimelb.zoom.us/j/83059420071?pwd=VitKZjhvdkxmKzR6dmduLzhXYUI1UT09). Discussion about the seminar takes place on the [Rising Sea Discord](https://discord.gg/9yBaAxPSK8) in the channel `#cglseminar`. There will be a moderator in each seminar who will monitor the Zoom and Discord chat and pass along questions to the speaker. Talks will be recorded and posted to the [CGL YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJTk6uSbSsclXN8v3b27_QQ) within about a week.

Co-organised by [Will Troiani](https://williamtroiani.github.io) and [Daniel Murfet](http://www.therisingsea.org).

# Abstracts

**Will Troiani** "Proof-nets: the sequentialisation theorem"

Proof-structures, invented by J.Y.Girard 1986 paper "Linear Logic", is a variant on a sequent style calculus, proof-nets are non-sequential in nature. More precisely, this means the translation of sequent style linear logic into proof-nets loses the information of the order of various pairs of connectives. Moreover, this leniency on the side of proof-structures is so much so, that there exists proof-structures which do not come from the translation of any sequent style proof. Those structures which do lie in the image of this translation are the proof-nets, and so we are left with a question: how can we check whether a proof-structure is a proof-net? The answer to this question is given by the Sequentialization Theorem, which states that checks of certain paths on the underlying graph of the proof-structure determines the answer. This correctness criterion is the foundation upon which Girard's Geometry of Interaction I, a program set on interpreting proof-nets geometrically, rests. This two part talk is dedicated to proving the Sequentialization Theorem. The first of which will be concerned with carefully defining sequent style linear logic, proof-nets, and the translation from one to the other. The second part will then proceed to the proof of the Theorem.
