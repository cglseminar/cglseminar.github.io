A [mad day's work](https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2001-38-04/S0273-0979-01-00913-2/S0273-0979-01-00913-2.pdf) in theoretical computer science, mathematical logic, algebraic geometry and statistical learning theory.

The seminar takes place on every second Thursday (see below for the schedule) in the Russell Love room of Peter Hall at the University of Melbourne, 11am-12pm AEDT. The seminars will also be streamed live via [Zoom](https://unimelb.zoom.us/j/83059420071?pwd=VitKZjhvdkxmKzR6dmduLzhXYUI1UT09). Discussion about the seminar takes place on the [Rising Sea Discord](https://discord.gg/9yBaAxPSK8) in the channel `#cglseminar`. There will be a moderator in each seminar who will monitor the Zoom and Discord chat and pass along questions to the speaker. Talks will be recorded and posted to the [CGL YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJTk6uSbSsclXN8v3b27_QQ) within about a week.

Co-organised by [Will Troiani](https://williamtroiani.github.io), Edmund Lau Tiew Hong and [Daniel Murfet](http://www.therisingsea.org).

# Abstracts

**Will Troiani** "Proof-nets: the sequentialisation theorem"

Proof-structures, invented by J.Y.Girard in his 1986 paper "Linear Logic", are a variant on sequent style proofs. Proof-structures are non-sequential in nature so the translation of sequent style linear logic proofs into proof-nets erases information about the order of connectives. The map from sequent calculus proofs to proof-structures is not surjective, and the image of this translation are the *proof-nets*. This leads to the question: how can we intrinsically characterise proof-nets among proof-structures?

The answer to this question is given by the Sequentialization Theorem, which gives a correctness criterion which detects proof-nets among proof-structures. This correctness criterion is the foundation upon which Girard's Geometry of Interaction I, a program set on interpreting proof-nets geometrically, rests. This two part talk is dedicated to proving the Sequentialization Theorem. The first part will be concerned with carefully defining sequent style linear logic, proof-nets, and the translation from one to the other. The second part will then proceed to the proof of the Theorem.
